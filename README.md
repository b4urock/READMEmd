# Hey there! 

Welcome to my place, grab a chair, sit down and lets talk about technology! :)

# Passionate about improving myself all the time
I'm a seasoned Oracle Specialist with a demonstrated history of working in the insurance industry and I've discovered a new world of possibilities with Data Analysis and Analytics. I'm hopelessly in love with them!

# Goals for 2023
- Improve my new Python/Storytelling superpowers.
- Launch a product to help people stay emotionally connected.
